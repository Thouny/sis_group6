# sis_group6

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Whenever new code updates are committed to this repository, you need to fetch them with the following commands (from within your project directory):

```
git pull
flutter pub get
```

The second command pulls in any dependencies and is needed before your first attempt to build/run, and again each time the `pubspec.yaml` file has changed.

## Debug build

The debug build is used during development for faster edit/compile/run cycles.
